# psych-DS

Welcome to the Psych Data Structures project! (Maybe we'll have a snappier name in the future.) This is an in-progress community attempt to define a standard way of formatting and documenting scientific datasets. It incorporates a few types of existing recommendations for organizing our work (well-formatted spreadsheets, data dictionaries, and sensible folder structure) into a technical specification - a series of requirements for file structure and format that constitute a standard machine-readable template. Some advantages of having a techincal specification:

* From the beginning of a project, a researcher can format their data in a way that is likely to make their life easy for data analysis & management, and which will be easy to document and share.

* People who make software tools for working with these datasets can write simpler code, and clearly communicate to a user what their data needs to look like to work with the tool.

* Repositories (and researchers) can extract critical information about datasets to display them and make them discoverable (e.g. indexed by Google Datasets and other search tools.)  

This is an ongoing project, and we are actively looking for contributors! (See How to Get Involved)

Right now, discussions about this project take place via comments/edits to the (technical specification draft)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8o5jnWk0Iqp_J06PTu5NjBfVsdoPbBhstht6W0fFp0/edit?usp=sharing] and on the (mailing list)[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psych-data-standards].
