# psych-DS

Welcome to the Psych Data Structures project! (Maybe we'll have a snappier name in the future.) This is an in-progress community attempt to define a standard way of formatting and documenting scientific datasets. It started as a hackathon at SIPS 2018. The Data Structure incorporates a few types of existing recommendations for organizing our work (well-formatted spreadsheets, data dictionaries, and sensible folder structure) into a technical specification - a series of requirements for file structure and format that constitute a standard machine-readable template. Some advantages of having a techincal specification:

* From the beginning of a project, a researcher can format their data in a way that is likely to make their life easy for data analysis & management, and which will be easy to document and share.

* People who make software tools for working with these datasets can write simpler code, and clearly communicate to a user what their data needs to look like to work with the tool.

* Repositories (and researchers) can extract critical information about datasets to display them and make them discoverable (e.g. indexed by Google Datasets and other search tools.)  

This is an ongoing project, and we are actively looking for contributors! (See How to Get Involved)

# Ground rules/code of conduct

We haven't yet adopted a formal code of conduct, but please see the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct) (which has been adopted by a number of open source projects) for general expectations. Please contact Melissa (mekline@mit.edu) if you have any concerns.

# Project Documents

This repository serves as the root/entry point for the Psych-DS project, but most project docs and discussions are elsewhere. 

[Draft Technical Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8o5jnWk0Iqp_J06PTu5NjBfVsdoPbBhstht6W0fFp0/edit?usp=sharing) - this is the main document we are working on.
[OpenCanvas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GQUpUPL3dHGc-Eb_3dL6WcXnA4hXpUanjAc8jUp16S0/edit?usp=sharing) - a basic definition/roadmap for the project (constructed for the Mozilla Open Leaders workshop and open for comment!)

Things we will need to have in the future:

- A website!

- Example datasets. We are not quite ready to start road-testing the specification on datasets, but when we do, examples of your datasets from across subfields, methods, populations, and measurement types will be critical for making sure this works for its intended audience!

- (Please add to this list)

# Roadmap

Some significant milestones:

- Release a prototype specification that researchers can try to meet on a dataset; call for feedback and/or example datasets.
  
Doing this requires that we have a stable enough metadata schema/directory structure, and a list of instructions for how people should prepare and submit a dataset to us.

- Version 1.0 Launch! In addition to the above:

-- A polished webpage

-- Curated examples of datasets to spec (for developers, and for researchers looking for examples)

-- Edited instruction documents (especially if we can point people to tools that make preparation easier.)

-- What else?

# How to Get Involved

Right now, discussions about this project take place via comments/edits to the [technical specification draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8o5jnWk0Iqp_J06PTu5NjBfVsdoPbBhstht6W0fFp0/edit?usp=sharing) and on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psych-data-standards). 

Please also feel free to contact me (Melissa Kline, mekline@mit.edu) if you have further questions.
